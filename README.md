Learning goals:

This challenge helped me get a better understanding of html, css and git . By implementing what I learned, I was able to make the code look better by using semantic naming and conventions.

Development team:

Mamadou yaya diallo.

Notes:

On my last commit of the index.html (style the nav bar), I actually wanted to put (Changing the tittle to Horiseon).
On my last commit of the css (Changing title to Horiseon), I wanted to change the title because I made the mistake on the index.html, so I added a word in css to push it but it is showing exactly what was changed.
On some of the commits, I tried to change the image to png or JPP because the digital-marketing-meeting.jpg wasnâ€™t loading on my google so I though about changing the image. I tried it on another browser and it worked so my code was good.
